In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event taking place, such as the probability of a team winning, of a patient being healthy, etc. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.
